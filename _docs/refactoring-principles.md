# Refactoring Principles - AI Starter Kit

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each function, class or module should have only one reason to change.
Large functions with inline comments should be broken down into small well-named functions.

## Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
Avoid code duplication. Extract common parts into reusable functions.

## You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)
Don't implement features until they are necessary.

## Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)
Favor simple and understandable solutions.

## AI-Assisted Refactoring
- Ask AI to identify code smells
- Use AI to propose refactorings
- Keep control of important architectural decisions

## Continuous Refactoring
- Refactor regularly during development
- Don't wait for code to be "perfect"
- Use tests to secure refactorings

## Warning Signs
- Functions over 50 lines
- Duplicated code
- Poorly named variables
- Comments that explain what the code does
